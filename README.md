# The Dilip Aich Effect
 This snippet helps developers to recieve and send data using Html Elements other than the form, like the Div, H1, or basically any HTML Element.

 Altogether they are the same functions in different format. But certainly made my life as a developer easier.

 Include a Jquery Library for this to work seamlessly.
