# The Dilip Aich Effect
 This snippet helps developers to recieve and send data using Html Elements other than the form, like the Div, H1, or basically any HTML Element.

 To make it fun, I have made the snippets using MCU Characters & Each Name denotes the power of the function.
 Altogether they are the same functions in different format. But certainly made my life as a developer easier.
